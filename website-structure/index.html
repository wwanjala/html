          Kenya facts Kenya’s geography Even if you’ve never been to Kenya,
          chances are you know what it looks like. Kenya’s savannah is familiar
          from movies, TV shows, books and even adverts on the telly. It’s the
          landscape many people imagine when they think of Africa. Kenya is
          located in East Africa. Its terrain rises from a low coastal plain on
          the Indian Ocean to mountains and plateaus (areas of level high
          ground) at its centre. Most Kenyans live in the highlands, where
          Nairobi, the capital, sits at an altitude of 1,700 metres. Kenya facts
          - map of Kenya West of Nairobi the land descends to the Great Rift
          Valley, a 6,400-kilometre tear in the Earth’s crust. Within this
          valley in the deserts of northern Kenya are the green waters of famous
          Lake Turkana. Kenyan people & culture In Kenya, more than 60 languages
          are spoken and there are more than 40 ethnic groups. Almost everyone
          there speaks more than one African language. Kenya Facts - tribe
          School is free in Kenya, but many children are too busy to go to
          classes. They help their families by working the land, tending cattle,
          cooking, or fetching water. Music and storytelling are important parts
          of Kenyan culture. For centuries, tribes throughout the country have
          used songs, stories and poems to pass on their beliefs, history, and
          customs. Kenya’s nature Millions of people visit Kenya each year to
          see its endless savannah and the animals that inhabit it: elephants,
          lions, cheetahs, giraffes, zebras, hippos, rhinos and more. The Kenyan
          government has set up more than 50 reserves and parks to protect these
          animals. People hoping to spot some amazing African wildlife usually
          focus on Kenya’s lowland savannah. But Kenya’s ecosystems also include
          deserts, swamps, mountain and forests. Each region has its own mix of
          plants and animals that are suited to the area’s particular
          conditions. Kenya was a colony of the United Kingdom from 1920 until
          1963. Since its independence, it has been a republic, with a
          president, a national assembly, called the Bunge, and a legal system.
          Each year on 12 December, the country celebrates its independence day
          – or Jamhuri Day – with parades, dancing, political speeches and
          feasts! The bones of one of the earliest human ancestors ever found
          were discovered in Kenya’s Turkana Basin.
